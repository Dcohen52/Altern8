Syntax
To read from a file in your Altern8 code, you can use the following syntax:

    var file = open_file(filename, mode)
Here, "filename" refers to the name of the file you want to open, and "mode" refers to the mode in which you want to open the file.

To write to a file in your Altern8 code, you can use the following syntax:

    var file = create_file(filename, mode)
Here, "filename" refers to the name of the file you want to create or overwrite, and "mode" refers to the mode in which you want to open the file.

To close a file in your Altern8 code, you can use the following syntax:

    close_file(file)
Here, "file" refers to the file object you want to close.

Modes

The "open_file" and "create_file" functions should support the following modes:
"r": read mode (default)
"w": write mode (overwrite file)
"a": append mode (append to file)
"x": exclusive creation mode (create a new file and fail if it already exists)

Reading from Files
    When you open a file in read mode, you should be able to read its contents using the following functions:
    read_file(file): read the entire contents of the file as a string
    read_line(file): read a single line from the file as a string
    read_lines(file): read all the lines of the file into a list of strings
    Writing to Files
    When you open a file in write or append mode, you should be able to write to the file using the following functions:
    write_file(file, string): write a string to the file
    write_lines(file, list_of_strings): write a list of strings to the file, one per line

Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use the file handling functions in your Altern8 code:

Example 1: Reading from a file
file = open_file('my_file.txt', 'r')
contents = read_file(file)
close_file(file)
Here, the "open_file" function opens the file "my_file.txt" in read mode, and the "read_file" function reads its contents into the "contents" variable. The "close_file" function closes the file when you're done reading from it.

Example 2: Writing to a file

var file = create_file('my_file.txt', 'w')
write_file(file, 'Hello, world!')
close_file(file)
Here, the "create_file" function creates the file "my_file.txt" in write mode, and the "write_file" function writes the string "Hello, world!" to the file. The "close_file" function closes the file when you're done writing to it.

Example 3: Appending to a file


var file = open_file('my_file.txt', 'a')
write_file(file, 'Hello, again!')
close_file(file)
Here, the "open_file" function opens the file "my_file.txt" in append mode, and the "write_file" function writes the string "Hello, again!" to the end of the file. The "close_file" function closes the file when you're done appending to it.
